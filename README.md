ABANDONWARE - Microsoft no longer releases WebMatrix.

Convert color schemes from https://studiostyl.es to work with WebMatrix

WebMatrix 2.0 supports code color theming but uses a different .XML file than Visual Studio's. This simple app converts a .vssettings file into a color scheme importable by WebMatrix.
Export from VS or download from [https://StudioStyl.es](https://StudioStyl.es), then convert and import.
